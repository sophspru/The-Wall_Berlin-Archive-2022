            Berlin 2022, Personal Archive</h1>
        <p class="abstract">
            Since I was little, I love stories. For this reason, I like to keep train tickets, receipts, flyers, during 
            the trips I take, because their stories help me relive the moments I've passed and remember the people I've met. 
            Start studying in the field of visual communication, I realized how interesting it was to preserve paper artifacts 
            from a place different from mine; both the positive examples and the curious ones still constitute solutions to 
            communication problems by someone other than me and from whom I can learn something.
            In 2022 I had the chance to study for one semester in Berlin. The impact with a place so different from the one 
            I came from was immediately a constant source of inspiration, which intrigued me. Right from the start, I started storing 
            postcards, tickets, stickers, handwritten notes, in a box. Once back, that box was a nostalgic collection of memories 
            and a small personal archive of my experience.

         <p>
            The elements I have collected are of various nature and origin, both paper and small objects. 
            To represent them in my archive, I decided to proceed by scanning everything that was paper and 
            photographing the objects in 3D, and then proceeding for both categories with a contour cut in Photoshop.

        <p>
            Berlin is an eclectic city, multicultural and with various influences. Since the items of the archive 
            are already reflecting this, I decided to keep a neutral background, using a picture of concrete. The grey 
            color doesn't interfere with the colors of the elements, allowing their readability. I choose concrete 
            also to connect this archive to the imagery of a wall, a symbol of division for the city, that right now 
            - as for my archive - represent connection to the past, memories. I wanted to add an horizonal scroll 
            instead of the vertical one, to create a sense of disconfort for the user, the same disconfort I had when
            I first arrived in Berlin, but I didn't managed to. 
        </p>

            <img src="src/img/D.2.png" alt="" />

        <p>
            Regarding the text, at first I wanted to recreate the buttons and the title in a graffiti style, as if they
            were done on the wall. Since I couldn't manage to make the font work, I decided to use "Berlin", a font created
            by the HvD foundry, based on the corporate identity created for the city in 2020 by Jung von Matt. It is a font 
            studied starting from the entire city signage, which therefore combines ancient and modern.

        <p>
            For the title, I opted for a blue background and white, as a reminder for the metro (Ubahn) of Berlin.

            <img src="src/img/D.5.png" alt="" />
      
        <p>
            The rest of the text (on the buttons and on the image description) are a palette of three color: white, black and yellow,
            identifying the city. The rest of the text (on the buttons and on the image description) is a palette of three colors: white, 
            black and yellow, identifying the city. The only button that is different from the others is the "shuffle" one; the word is 
            replaced by the "S" logo of the urban train line.

        <p>
            The buttons at the top are filters, which allow you to view a precise category of elements. I have decided on a subdivision into 
            2D or 3D and for each of these two categories, I have foreseen at least one further division.

            Next to the filters, it is possible to select the display order of the items: in ascending or descending order of collection date.

            To move from one element to the next, once selected, I tried to train Google's Teachable Machine to recognize images, namely the iconic 
            Ampelmann (the little man depicted on the pedestrian traffic light). Unfortunately I ran into some trouble setting up the code and couldn't 
            get it to work.

            As an alternative, I've replaced this method with using the keyboard: typing the letter "p" takes you back to the previous item, 
            typing "n" takes you to the next item.

            Berlin has been a city that over time I have greatly appreciated, in all its positive and negative aspects. I plan to go back there very
            often and continue my collection and consequently also the archive. It will be even more interesting to see in a few years what I have collected.
